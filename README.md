# üìä FastAPI Excel Processor

A FastAPI-based project to process and expose data from an Excel `.xls` file via a RESTful API. This assignment demonstrates the ability to work with tabular data, extract structure programmatically, and build robust endpoints using FastAPI.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a FastAPI application that:
- Parses a provided Excel sheet (`Data/capbudg.xls`)
- Dynamically detects structured tables based on uppercase headers and NaN logic
- Exposes endpoints for table listing, row inspection, and row-wise numeric summarization

---

## ‚úÖ Features

### üßæ Excel Sheet Structure Recognition

- Detects **tables** based on **uppercase cells** followed by `NaN` in adjacent columns
- Associates **row names** with the table if they immediately follow a table name
- Stops parsing a table's rows when a `NaN` is encountered in the first column

### üåê REST API Endpoints

Base URL: `http://localhost:9090`

### üìå 1. `GET /list_tables`

**Description**: Lists all table names detected in the Excel file.  
**Logic**: A table is recognized as a fully **uppercase** cell with all NaNs in the rest of the row.
